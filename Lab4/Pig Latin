Pig Latin :

1. Load : 													//To load data into variable
		varName = Load 'path_to_file' using PigStorage('separator') as (var_name:datatype..);

		divs = load 'NYSE_dividends' using PigStorage(',');
		divs = load 'NYSE_dividends' as (exchange, symbol, date, dividends);

2. Store :													//To store data into FS.
		Store varName into 'path' using PigStorage('separator')
		store processed into 'processed' using PigStorage(',');

3. Dump :													//To view data into grunt.
		dump processed;

4. foreach :												//To loop overdata
		newVar = foreach oldVar generate ...

		gain = foreach prices generate close - open; 
		gain2 = foreach prices generate $6 - $3;
		in_cents = foreach divs generate dividends * 100.0 as dividend, dividends * 100.0;

5. Filter :													//To filter out data.
		newVar = filter oldVar by innerVar relOperator value;

		X = FILTER A BY f3 == 3;

6. Group :													//to group up data
		newVar = group oldVar by innerVar;

		grpd = group daily by stock;
		cnt = foreach grpd generate group, COUNT(daily);
		avg = foreach grpd generate group, AVG(daily.dividends);

7. Order by :
		
		bydate = order daily by date;

		byclose = order daily by close desc, open;

8. Distinct :
		uniq = distinct daily;

9. Join :
